            As previously stated, I'm an electronic engineer (a very innovative
            and challenge driven one), more focused in the software development
            branch. I have a passion for finding solutions to complex problems,
            which is why I'm diving deeper into the programming side of my
            career. So far I have completed courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            and Python, demonstrating my commitment to learning and growing in
            this field. My engineering background has equipped me with strong
            problem-solving skills and an analytical mindset, which I believe
            are crucial for any Developer role. I am eager to bring my technical
            skills to a dynamic team where I can contribute to challenging
            projects and continue to learn.
